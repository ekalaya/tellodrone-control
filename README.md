# Tellodrone-control
Drone DJI/Ryze Tello Controller using the Go programming language

Very early version with a lot of hacks.

**Needless to say I take no responsibility for any damage you caused to your drone. You should know exactly what you are doing before attempting to use any of this code.**

What works:
* Basic controls using a keyboard (up, down, rotate left, rotate right, forward, backward, left, right)
* Video stream
* Video save
* Flip controls work most of the time
* Flight data display(battery, height, speed, etc.)

## Usage

Fow Windows: download the exe file and three dlls. Remember to allow network access(Private & Public networks) in the Windows Firewall warning.

* Turn on the Tello
* Wait for it to initialise (flashing orange LED)
* Connect your computer to the Tello WiFi
* Run the exe

After a couple of seconds a video feed should appear - if it doesn't, then something is wrong so do not attempt to fly the Tello! You can try to rerun the exe if there's no video.

The recorded videos are in the "recordings/" folder. To convert it to a mp4 file, run:
```
ffmpeg -i "source.nal" -c:v copy -f mp4 "myOutputFile.mp4"
```
